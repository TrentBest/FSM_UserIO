# SemanticExpression

**Evidence:** Source-derived from [SemanticExpression](../../../SemanticInteraction.cs) and named tests in [SemanticInteractionTests.cs](../../../tests/FSM_UserIO.Tests/SemanticInteractionTests.cs). Checked against current development source; manually authored, not generator output.

## Purpose and contract

Represents an expression or proposal before semantic interpretation or authorization. It is not a SemanticIntent merely because its name resembles a command. Name is required and retained without trimming; ExpressedAt preserves the supplied timestamp; Source is optional but cannot be whitespace when supplied. Source is not authenticated identity. Tests cover required-name validation, optional source validation, and preservation of expression/source labels. No authority or execution is implied.

## Evidence and limits

The linked tests are evidence for the specific behaviors named above, not proof of host policy, trust, or runtime behavior beyond their assertions. See [API contracts](../../API_CONTRACTS.md), [interaction lifecycle](../../INTERACTION_LIFECYCLE.md), and [UML inventory](../README.md) for the broader semantic boundary and remaining diagram coverage.
