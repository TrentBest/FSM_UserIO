# InteractionContext

**Evidence:** Source-derived from [InteractionContext](../../../SemanticInteraction.cs) and named tests in [SemanticInteractionTests.cs](../../../tests/FSM_UserIO.Tests/SemanticInteractionTests.cs). Checked against current development source; manually authored, not generator output.

## Purpose and contract

Carries correlation and optional participant/session metadata without owning session lifecycle. CorrelationId must not be Guid.Empty. ParticipantId is optional and cannot be whitespace when supplied; it is application-defined metadata, not an authenticated principal. SessionId is optional and cannot be Guid.Empty when supplied. Tests cover supplied/omitted metadata and invalid identifiers. Session creation, expiration, authorization, and correlation policy belong to the host.

## Evidence and limits

The linked tests are evidence for the specific behaviors named above, not proof of host policy, trust, or runtime behavior beyond their assertions. See [API contracts](../../API_CONTRACTS.md), [interaction lifecycle](../../INTERACTION_LIFECYCLE.md), and [UML inventory](../README.md) for the broader semantic boundary and remaining diagram coverage.
